Lesson-03-Level-08,ellipses_present,1,llm_check,"The four orange ellipses are present in a 2x2 grid with 50 pixel spacing. Count it as OK if each ellipse is drawn while the current fill is orange (literal ""orange"" or a variable set to ""orange"").",,
Lesson-03-Level-08,purple_rect_after_fill,4,llm_check,"A rectangle is drawn after a call that sets fill to purple (either the literal ""purple"" or a variable assigned ""purple""). The rectangle call may be rect(x,y) or rect(x,y,width,height); rectangle x and y coordinates must be within 10 pixels of the coordinates of the first ellipse (the ellipse in the top-left corner of the 2x2 grid)",,
Lesson-03-Level-08,rect_after_ellipses,4,llm_check,The (purple) rectangle’s draw call appears later in the code than the four orange ellipse calls (so it is on top by draw order). It does not have to be the last shape in the program.,,
